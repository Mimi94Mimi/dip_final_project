# Introduction
This is the final project of Digital Image Processing, which mainly focuses on color transfer, including implementation such as:
1. comparison between two color transfer methods, say Basic color transfer and IDT transfer. 
2. TMR filter for optimizing the result generated by IDT transfer
3. Propose my color transfer method to tackle with the defect resulted from TMR filter

**Please refer to report.pdf for more details**
